1. How many bits does it take to represent the values from 0 to 255?
One byte can store 256 values. The range of 0 to 255 contains 256 values, so
it can be stored in one byte. One byte is equal to 8 bits.

Each color takes one byte to store, so a color in the RGB color model would take
3 bytes to store.
